-- Placeholder migration
-- NOTE: This is a placeholder created locally to match a migration already applied in the database.
-- Prisma reported that the database has a migration named "20251022102610_" which was not found locally.
-- DO NOT APPLY blindly in production. Replace this file with the real historical migration SQL if available.

-- No-op to avoid accidental schema changes. Keep as a placeholder for history alignment.
